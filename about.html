            What is Software Compare?
        </h1>
        <p>
            It is hard to find simple and objective data on software online, 
            and this may lead to users being unsure as to which piece of software works best for them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Software Compare aims to provide people tools to 
            choose software that best suits their needs. The charts compare
            an assortment of criteria such as privacy, usability, etc. which allow users to assess their own needs and 
            decide which software suits them best.
