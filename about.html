        What is Software Compare?
    </h1>
    <p>
        SoftwareCompare aims to solve the problem of easily finding simple and objective data on software online.
        This site provides tools to aid people in their journey of choosing software that best suits their needs. The
        charts compare
        an assortment of criteria such as privacy, usability, etc. which allow users to assess their own needs and
        discover applications that best meet those needs.

    <h2>
        Who Maintains this Site?
    </h2>
    <p>
        This website was created and maintained by David Collini. I am
        currently majoring in Computer Science at Stevens Institute
        of Technology. My main focus is on digital privacy, digital freedom,
        and open source software.
    </p>
    <h2>
        How is this site funded?
    </h2>
    <p>
        This site does not make money on its own, and instead relies on donations.
        I currently support donations through <a href="donate.html">multiple crypto wallets</a> and Brave Creators, with
        Liberapay, and XMRchat coming soon. If you enjoy
        the work I put into this site, consider making a donation to support further
        development and maintenance of the site.

    <h2>
        Transparency & Open Source
    </h2>
    <p>
        I licensed this site under the Open Source AGPLv3 license and am
        currently hosting it on Github pages. The repository can be found
        <a href="https://github.com/SoftwareCompare/SoftwareCompare">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I do hold and accept BAT, but other than that, Software Compare is not associated with any of the software it
        portrays on its site.
    </p>
