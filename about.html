            What is Software Compare?
        </h1>
        <p>
            SoftwareCompare aims to solve the problem of easily finding simple and objective data on software online.
            This site provides tools to aid people in their journey of choosing software that best suits their needs. The charts compare
            an assortment of criteria such as privacy, usability, etc. which allow users to assess their own needs and 
            discover applications that best meet those needs.

        </h2>
        <p>
            This website was created and maintained by David Collini. I am 
            currently majoring in Computer Science at Stevens Institute 
            of Technology. My main focus is on digital privacy, digital freedom, 
            and open source software.

            How is this site funded?
        </h2>
        <p>
            This site does not make money on its own, and instead relies on donations.
            I currently support donations through <a href="donate.html">multiple crypto wallets</a> and Brave Creators, with 
            Liberapay, and XMRchat coming soon. If you enjoy 
            the work I put into this site, consider making a donation to support further 
            development and maintenance of the site.

            I licensed this site under the Open Source AGPLv3 license and am 
            currently hosting it on Github pages. The repository can be found

            I do hold and accept BAT, but other than that, Software Compare is not associated with any of the software it
            portrays on its site.
