        About
    </h1>
    <p>
        There are many software comparison sites on the internet, but many only cover one specific category of applications,
        have a messy UI or profit through applications paying to rank their application higher. SoftwareCompare solves these issues by providing
        objective data on applications and letting the user decide which application works best for them. Through our approach of 
        keeping development open source, we not only ensure that our website's code is visible, but we also allow contributors to suggest 
        changes directly to the site. This project's stance on open development and openness to accept requests ensures that the 
        comparisons reflect what the community cares about in the software they use.
        <br />
        <br />
        The charts on the site compare an assortment of criteria such as privacy, security, convenience, ethics, etc. since we 
        want to ensure that the site not only caters to technology-minded people, but also to everyday people.
