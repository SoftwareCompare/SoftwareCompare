            What is Software Compare?
        </h1>
        <p>
            It is hard to find simple and objective data on software online, 
            and this may cause confusion for someone in search of software to use
        </p>
        <p>
            Software Compare aims to provide people tools to 
            choose software that best suits their needs. The charts compare
            an assortment of criteria, but users access their own needs and 
            decide which software suits them best.

            Who Created this Site?
        </h2>
        <p>
            This website was created by David Collini on Github. I am 
            currently majoring in Computer Science at Stevens Institute 
            of Technology. I have a strong interest and focus on digital privacy 
            and open source software.

            How do you make money?
        </h2>
        <p>
            This site does not make money on its own, and relies on donations.
            I'm currently working on opening donations through Brave Creators, 
            multiple crypto wallets, and Liberapay. If you enjoy the work I put 
            into this site, consider making a donation to support further 
            development and maintenance of the site.
